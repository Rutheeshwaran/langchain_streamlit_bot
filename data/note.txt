Abstract
Online communities across social platforms play a pivotal role in fostering communication, knowledge sharing, and social interaction in the digital age. These communities, spanning platforms like Discord, Facebook Groups, Telegram, and WhatsApp, generate vast amounts of user-generated content that reflects emotions, opinions, and engagement levels. However, managing and analyzing sentiment within these spaces involves significant challenges, including fragmented data, varying user demographics, and the need for real-time insights into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Traditional methods, such as manual reviews or basic spreadsheets, often lead to incomplete analyses, limited scalability, and inefficiencies in understanding user behavior. As online interactions grow more diverse and global, the absence of a centralized system for sentiment analysis becomes a critical barrier to effective community moderation and strategy development. This internship project addressed this gap by developing a Sentiment Analysis Dashboard for Online Communities using Microsoft Power BI, a premier business intelligence tool extensively utilized in industry for data-driven decision-making.

The project employed a structured methodology, starting with data collection and preprocessing to ensure data quality, accuracy, and relevance. Raw data from social platforms, including user posts, reactions, and metadata, was gathered and cleaned to eliminate inconsistencies, handle missing values, and standardize formats for integration into Power BI. Following preparation, the dashboard was designed with an emphasis on interactivity, visual clarity, and user-friendly navigation. Key visualizations included bar charts to illustrate topic interest by platform (e.g., community discussions vs. daily life activities), line charts to compare actual versus predicted sentiment accuracy over time, scatter plots to explore correlations between engagement and sentiment types, and stacked bars to display emoji reactions by location and demographic factors such as gender (female, male, non-binary) and profession (e.g., engineers, business owners, homemakers).

The dashboard offers multifaceted insights. It allows stakeholders to compare sentiment distributions across platforms, identifying trends like higher positive sentiments in Telegram groups or elevated negative reactions in Discord communities. Additionally, it reveals demographic influences, such as professionals in engineering showing more neutral engagement, and location-based patterns, with users in India exhibiting 45% negative sentiments compared to more positive trends in the US and France. By doing so, the dashboard functions as both an analytical tool and a strategic aid, minimizing reliance on static reports and enabling proactive community management.

In addition to practical benefits, the internship yielded substantial professional growth. It provided hands-on experience with Power BI's advanced features, including data modeling, DAX expressions for sentiment calculations, and custom themes. Furthermore, the project honed skills in data visualization, analytical reasoning, and storytelling through insights, which are essential in today's data-centric industries. By transforming raw social data into actionable visualizations, this project illustrates the application of business intelligence in digital ecosystems to enhance user satisfaction, optimize content strategies, and promote evidence-based moderation.

1. Introduction
In the digital era, online communities serve as dynamic hubs for knowledge sharing, social interaction, and collaborative discourse. Platforms such as Discord, Facebook Groups, Telegram, and WhatsApp host diverse user interactions, ranging from casual discussions on daily life and family activities to professional topics in engineering, business, and homemaking. These communities not only foster creativity and networking but also bridge geographical and cultural gaps, enabling global participation. However, the vast volume of user-generated content—posts, reactions, and engagements—presents unique challenges in understanding underlying sentiments, which can be positive, negative, or neutral. Effective sentiment analysis is essential for community moderators, platform administrators, and stakeholders to gauge user satisfaction, detect potential conflicts, and tailor content strategies accordingly. Despite their significance, managing online communities involves resource-intensive efforts, including monitoring engagement levels, demographic influences (e.g., gender: female, male, non-binary; professions: business owners, engineers, homemakers), and location-based reactions (e.g., emoji counts from users in India, US, France, Germany, Brazil, UK, Canada). Factors such as topic relevance, platform-specific dynamics, and user demographics determine the overall health and growth of these communities. With multiple platforms and user segments involved, administrators often struggle to track sentiments in a structured manner, leading to fragmented insights and inefficient decision-making.

The present study, titled Sentiment Analysis of Online Communities Across Social Platforms, addresses this gap by applying a data analytics framework to evaluate sentiment performance across platforms. The analysis focuses on parameters such as actual versus predicted sentiment accuracy, topic interest by platform, engagement counts, and demographic distributions. By integrating these into a centralized Power BI dashboard, the project provides a consolidated view of community dynamics. This empowers decision-makers with actionable insights that can improve content moderation, enhance user engagement, and ensure efficient resource allocation for platform growth.

Thus, the introduction of data-driven sentiment analysis into online community management not only ensures accountability but also aligns with the modern digital ecosystem, where evidence-based decision-making is essential for sustainable community development and user retention.

2. Objectives of the Study
The primary aim of this study is to explore the dynamics of online community sentiment through a data-driven approach, providing actionable insights to enhance platform management and user experience. Specifically, the objectives are:

To Measure Sentiment and Engagement Levels – Sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) and engagement metrics (e.g., post counts, reactions) serve as direct indicators of user satisfaction and activity. By analyzing these across platforms like Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp, the study evaluates which topics or communities attract the most interest and whether engagement correlates with sentiment trends.
To Analyze Demographic Influences – Demographic factors such as gender (female, male, non-binary), profession (e.g., engineers, business owners, homemakers), and location (e.g., India, US, France) play a critical role in shaping sentiment. This objective assesses how these variables affect sentiment distribution, identifying patterns like higher neutral engagement among professionals or location-specific reactions (e.g., 45% negative sentiment in India).
To Evaluate Platform Efficiency – By comparing sentiment accuracy (actual vs. predicted) and engagement across platforms, the study investigates which platforms perform best in reflecting user emotions and sustaining activity, highlighting opportunities for optimization in moderation or content delivery.
To Track Reaction Patterns – Emoji reactions and other user interactions provide insights into emotional responses. This objective focuses on identifying trends, such as location-based emoji usage (e.g., higher positive emojis in the US), to inform targeted community strategies.
To Provide Visual Insights through Dashboards – A core goal is to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows stakeholders to filter and analyze data by platform, topic, or demographic segment. This transforms raw sentiment data into accessible, visual insights for real-time decision-making.
To Recommend Actionable Strategies for Improvement – Based on the findings, the study aims to guide platform administrators in optimizing content, addressing negative sentiment areas, and enhancing user retention through evidence-based recommendations.
By achieving these objectives, the project establishes a foundation for data-driven sentiment analysis, enabling improved community moderation, enhanced user engagement, and sustainable growth of online ecosystems.

3. Problem Statement
Online communities across social platforms, such as Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Groups, have become indispensable for fostering interaction, collaboration, and knowledge exchange in the digital landscape. However, managing these communities effectively is fraught with persistent challenges that undermine their potential. These issues stem from the following critical problems:

Inefficient Sentiment Moderation – Certain platforms exhibit significant negative sentiment concentrations—e.g., 45% negative reactions in India for specific topics—due to the lack of robust tools for real-time monitoring. This often results in unresolved conflicts, reduced user trust, and increased churn rates, hindering community health.
Imbalanced Engagement Efforts – Engagement levels vary widely across demographic segments and platforms. For instance, engineers may display neutral sentiment, while homemakers show stronger positive responses, yet current strategies often fail to account for these differences. This imbalance leads to uneven participation and missed opportunities to enhance community vitality.
Difficulty in Tracking Reactions – User reactions, including emojis, likes, and comments, are vital indicators of emotional climate and engagement. However, there is no systematic method to track and analyze these reactions across diverse locations (e.g., US vs. Brazil) or topics (e.g., family activities vs. professional discussions), limiting the ability to adapt content or moderation approaches effectively.
Absence of Integrated Reporting – Sentiment data is typically siloed across platforms, with no centralized mechanism to consolidate insights. This fragmentation forces administrators to rely on manual aggregation or platform-specific reports, resulting in delayed decision-making and a lack of holistic understanding of community dynamics.
Unclear Link Between Topics and Sentiments – The relationship between discussion topics and resulting sentiments remains poorly defined. For example, it is unclear whether family-oriented topics consistently yield positive sentiments or if professional topics trigger neutral or negative responses. This ambiguity complicates content planning and prevents stakeholders from justifying resource allocation or predicting user behavior with confidence.
Inadequate Demographic Insights – Variations in sentiment based on gender (e.g., female, male, non-binary), profession (e.g., engineers, business owners, homemakers), and location are often overlooked. Without a clear understanding of these influences, tailored strategies to address specific user groups cannot be developed, leading to generic and less effective interventions.
The fundamental problem, therefore, is the absence of a unified, data-driven system to analyze and manage sentiment across online communities. This study aims to address these challenges by designing a comprehensive analytical framework, supported by an interactive Power BI dashboard, to provide transparency, identify actionable insights, and enable proactive community management.

4. Data Collection and Sources
The credibility and depth of sentiment analysis hinge on the quality, diversity, and relevance of the data collected. For this project, a multi-faceted approach was adopted to gather comprehensive data from various sources, ensuring a robust foundation for analyzing online community dynamics across social platforms. The sources include:

Social Media Platform Exports – Detailed datasets extracted from platforms such as Discord, Facebook Groups, Telegram, and WhatsApp, encompassing user posts, comments, discussion threads, timestamps, and topic classifications (e.g., community discussions, daily life, professional interests). These exports provide the raw material for sentiment evaluation.
User Profile Data – Metadata capturing demographic attributes, including gender (female, male, non-binary), profession (e.g., engineers, business owners, homemakers, students), and geographical location (e.g., India, US, France, Germany, Brazil, UK, Canada). This data enables analysis of sentiment variations across user segments.
Reaction Logs – Comprehensive records of user interactions, such as emoji usage (e.g., thumbs up, heart, angry face), likes, shares, and comment counts, collected across platforms. These logs offer granular insights into emotional responses and engagement patterns, particularly when segmented by location or topic.
Sentiment Datasets – Pre-annotated datasets or outputs from sentiment analysis APIs (e.g., from tools like Text Blob or custom models), providing baseline sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) ranging from -1 to 1. These datasets serve as a reference for validating manually labeled or predicted sentiments.
Engagement Metrics – Aggregated data on user activity, including post frequency, session duration, and total interactions per user or topic, sourced from platform analytics or API endpoints. This complements sentiment data by linking emotional responses to behavioral trends.
Data Preprocessing - To ensure data integrity and usability, the collected information underwent rigorous cleaning and standardization processes. This included handling missing values (e.g., imputing unknown genders or locations with mode values), removing duplicate entries, correcting formatting errors (e.g., inconsistent timestamps), and resolving outliers (e.g., extreme sentiment scores). Numerical data, such as sentiment scores and engagement counts, was normalized to facilitate accurate comparisons, while categorical data (e.g., professions, locations) was encoded for seamless integration into Power BI. Additionally, text data from posts and comments was tokenized and cleaned to remove noise (e.g., special characters, URLs), ensuring compatibility with visualization tools. The resulting structured dataset provides a solid basis for meaningful analysis, visualization, and interpretation of sentiment trends across online communities.

5. Methodology
The study utilized a structured methodology to develop a Sentiment Analysis Dashboard for online communities using Microsoft Power BI, ensuring scientific rigor and practical utility. The process included the following steps:
